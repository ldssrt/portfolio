      <h4>UNFINISHING THE DIGITAL</h4>
        <p>Digital offers tools allowing constant reversibility and infinite iterations (ctrl+z, copy-paste…) which can lead us, designers, to a desire of achieving perfection. 
        However, the idea that one can have about “perfection” today is seen/thought through the prism of technique (and thus tools) which could lead to a standardization of digital aesthetics. 
        Indeed, while trying to achieve this technical perfection one could forget what makes the production sensitive, this being the individuality of its creator and the expression of their intention.</p>
        
    <p>This essay studies the way unfinishedness can allow digital designers to find some more creative freedom in an era where technical perfection tends to standardize the digital productions.</p>
    <p>This research will first question how unfinishedness is a transgression of the aesthetic canons, allowing artists to explore what makes an “artwork”. 
    This will lead us to discuss which effects the visibility of the creative process can create and how the spectator (or user) can become active thanks to unfinished productions.</p>
    <p>This paper aims to show how the imperfections of unfinished productions can renew aesthetics and digital productions by studying unfinished works. 
    This research will show that unfinishedness grants a more honest representation of the creative process, highlighting the accidents and errors of the digital medium. 
    Postponing the completion of works on the other hand will allow us to take advantage of the reversibility and iteration made possible by the digital. 
    Unfinishing a work also opens the creation to others, inciting sharing knowledge and the creation of new communities.</p>
    <p>These conclusions will lead us to wonder how such qualities could be used in video games or in the making of animation films in order to offer more original narratives and visuals.</p>
